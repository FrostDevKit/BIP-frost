# Frost Unique Key - BIP Proposal

This BIP proposes the integration of the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme into the Bitcoin protocol. FROST provides efficient and secure threshold signatures, leveraging a group G of prime order q with a hard Decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. The proposal assumes the existence of a generator g in G and employs a cryptographic hash function H mapping to Zâˆ—q.
