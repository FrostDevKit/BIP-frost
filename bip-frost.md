## Abstract

This BIP proposes the integration of Frost Multisig, a specific implementation of multisignature wallets, into the Bitcoin protocol.

## Motivation

Multisignature wallets provide enhanced security and control over funds by requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions. Frost is a specific implementation that offers multisig and privacy beyond add new layers security for who make self custody.

## Specification

### 1. Frost Multisig Parameters

- Number of Signers (N): [Specify the number of signers]
- Required Signatures (M): [Specify the number of required signatures]

### 2. Script Structure

Describe the structure of the multisignature script used by Frost, including any custom OP codes or variations from standard multisignature scripts.

### 3. Address Format

Specify the address format for Frost Multisig addresses, including any prefix or encoding specifics.

### 4. Compatibility

Discuss how Frost Multisig interacts with existing Bitcoin wallet software, network nodes, and other relevant components.

### 5. Security Considerations

Highlight the security features of Frost Multisig and any potential vulnerabilities that users should be aware of.

### 6. Examples

Provide examples of Frost Multisig transactions, including scripts and addresses.

## Rationale

Explain the reasoning behind the inclusion of Frost Multisig in the Bitcoin protocol, addressing the advantages it brings and how it aligns with the goals of the Bitcoin community.

## Backward Compatibility

Discuss any potential backward compatibility issues with existing wallet software or network nodes.

## Reference Implementation

If available, provide a reference implementation of Frost Multisig that can be used for testing and integration.

## Acknowledgments

Give credit to contributors, developers, or organizations that have played a significant role in the development of Frost Multisig.
